  # If you want to create the private network before calling this module,
  # you can do so and pass its id here. For example if you want to use a proxy
  # which only listens on your private network. Advanced use case.
  #
  # NOTE1: make sure to adapt network_ipv4_cidr, cluster_ipv4_cidr, and service_ipv4_cidr accordingly.
  #        If your network is created with 10.0.0.0/8, and you use subnet 10.128.0.0/9 for your
  #        non-k3s business, then adapting `network_ipv4_cidr = "10.0.0.0/9"` should be all you need.
  #
  # NOTE2: square brackets! This must be a list of length 1.
  #
  # existing_network_id = [hcloud_network.your_network.id]

  # If you must change the network CIDR you can do so below, but it is highly advised against.
  # network_ipv4_cidr = "10.0.0.0/8"

  # Using the default configuration you can only create a maximum of 42 agent-nodepools.
  # This is due to the creation of a subnet for each nodepool with CIDRs being in the shape of 10.[nodepool-index].0.0/16 which collides with k3s' cluster and service IP ranges (defaults below).
  # Furthermore the maximum number of nodepools (controlplane and agent) is 50, due to a hard limit of 50 subnets per network, see https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/networks/faq/.
  # So to be able to create a maximum of 50 nodepools in total, the values below have to be changed to something outside that range, e.g. `10.200.0.0/16` and `10.201.0.0/16` for cluster and service respectively.

  # If you must change the cluster CIDR you can do so below, but it is highly advised against.
  # Never change this value after you already initialized a cluster. Complete cluster redeploy needed!
  # The cluster CIDR must be a part of the network CIDR!
  # cluster_ipv4_cidr = "10.42.0.0/16"

  # If you must change the service CIDR you can do so below, but it is highly advised against.
  # Never change this value after you already initialized a cluster. Complete cluster redeploy needed!
  # The service CIDR must be a part of the network CIDR!
  # service_ipv4_cidr = "10.43.0.0/16"

  # If you must change the service IPv4 address of core-dns you can do so below, but it is highly advised against.
  # Never change this value after you already initialized a cluster. Complete cluster redeploy needed!
  # The service IPv4 address must be part of the service CIDR!
  # cluster_dns_ipv4 = "10.43.0.10"

  # For the control planes, at least three nodes are the minimum for HA. Otherwise, you need to turn off the automatic upgrades (see README).
  # **It must always be an ODD number, never even!** Search the internet for "split-brain problem with etcd" or see https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/ha-embedded/
  # For instance, one is ok (non-HA), two is not ok, and three is ok (becomes HA). It does not matter if they are in the same nodepool or not! So they can be in different locations and of various types.

  # Of course, you can choose any number of nodepools you want, with the location you want. The only constraint on the location is that you need to stay in the same network region, Europe, or the US.
  # For the server type, the minimum instance supported is cx22. The cax11 provides even better value for money if your applications are compatible with arm64; see https://www.hetzner.com/cloud.

  # IMPORTANT: Before you create your cluster, you can do anything you want with the nodepools, but you need at least one of each, control plane and agent.
  # Once the cluster is up and running, you can change nodepool count and even set it to 0 (in the case of the first control-plane nodepool, the minimum is 1).
  # You can also rename it (if the count is 0), but do not remove a nodepool from the list.

  # You can safely add or remove nodepools at the end of each list. That is due to how subnets and IPs get allocated (FILO).
  # The maximum number of nodepools you can create combined for both lists is 50 (see above).
  # Also, before decreasing the count of any nodepools to 0, it's essential to drain and cordon the nodes in question. Otherwise, it will leave your cluster in a bad state.

  # Before initializing the cluster, you can change all parameters and add or remove any nodepools. You need at least one nodepool of each kind, control plane, and agent.
  # ⚠️ The nodepool names are entirely arbitrary, but all lowercase, no special characters or underscore (dashes are allowed), and they must be unique.

  # If you want to have a single node cluster, have one control plane nodepools with a count of 1, and one agent nodepool with a count of 0.

  # Please note that changing labels and taints after the first run will have no effect. If needed, you can do that through Kubernetes directly.

  # Multi-architecture clusters are OK for most use cases, as container underlying images tend to be multi-architecture too.

  # Image and version of Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler for Hetzner Cloud:
  #   - cluster_autoscaler_image: Image of Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler for Hetzner Cloud to be used.
  #       The default is the official image from the Kubernetes project: registry.k8s.io/autoscaling/cluster-autoscaler
  #   - cluster_autoscaler_version: Version of Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler for Hetzner Cloud. Should be aligned with Kubernetes version.
  #       Available versions for the official image can be found at https://explore.ggcr.dev/?repo=registry.k8s.io%2Fautoscaling%2Fcluster-autoscaler
  #
  # Logging related arguments are managed using separate variables:
  #   - cluster_autoscaler_log_level: Controls the verbosity of logs (--v), the value is from 0 to 5, default is 4, for max debug info set it to 5.
  #   - cluster_autoscaler_log_to_stderr: Determines whether to log to stderr (--logtostderr).
  #   - cluster_autoscaler_stderr_threshold: Sets the threshold for logs that go to stderr (--stderrthreshold).
  #
  # Server/node creation timeout variable:
  #   - cluster_autoscaler_server_creation_timeout: Sets the timeout (in minutes) until which a newly created server/node has to become available before giving up and destroying it (defaults to 15, unit is minutes)
  #
  # Example:
  #
  # cluster_autoscaler_image = "registry.k8s.io/autoscaling/cluster-autoscaler"

  # lb_hostname Configuration:
  #
  # Purpose:
  # The lb_hostname setting optimizes communication between services within the Kubernetes cluster
  # when they use domain names instead of direct service names. By associating a domain name directly
  # with the Hetzner Load Balancer, this setting can help reduce potential communication delays.
  #
  # Scenario:
  # If Service B communicates with Service A using a domain (e.g., `a.mycluster.domain.com`) that points
  # to an external Load Balancer, there can be a slowdown in communication.
  #
  # Guidance:
  # - If your internal services use domain names pointing to an external LB, set lb_hostname to a domain
  #   like `mycluster.domain.com`.
  # - Create an A record pointing `mycluster.domain.com` to your LB's IP.
  # - Create a CNAME record for `a.mycluster.domain.com` (or xyz.com) pointing to `mycluster.domain.com`.
  #
  # Technical Note:
  # This setting sets the `load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/hostname` in the Hetzner LB definition, suitable for
  # HAProxy, Nginx and Traefik ingress controllers.
  #
  # Recommendation:
  # This setting is optional. If services communicate using direct service names, you can leave this unset.
  # For inter-namespace communication, use `.service_name` as per Kubernetes norms.
  #
  # Example:
  # lb_hostname = "mycluster.domain.com"

  # You can enable Rancher (installed by Helm behind the scenes) with the following flag, the default is "false".

  # See for options https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster#3-choose-your-ssl-configuration

  ### ADVANCED - Custom helm values for packages above (search _values if you want to located where those are mentioned upper in this file)
  # ⚠️ Inside the _values variable below are examples, up to you to find out the best helm values possible, we do not provide support for customized helm values.
  # Please understand that the indentation is very important, inside the EOTs, as those are proper yaml helm values.
  # We advise you to use the default values, and only change them if you know what you are doing!

  # You can inline the values here in heredoc-style (as the examples below with the <<EOT to EOT). Please note that the current indentation inside the EOT is important.
  # Or you can create a thepackage-values.yaml file with the content and use it here with the following syntax:
  # thepackage_values = file("thepackage-values.yaml")

  # Cilium, all Cilium helm values can be found at https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/master/install/kubernetes/cilium/values.yaml
  # Be careful when maintaining your own cilium_values, as the choice of available settings depends on the Cilium version used. See also the cilium_version setting to fix a specific version.
  # The following is an example, please note that the current indentation inside the EOT is important.
